This project is a decentralized certificate verification system built on blockchain. It involved the use of Python frontend framework-Streamlit to build the front end of the application.
For the backend, I used ethereum blockchain and IPFS to store the certificate with the corresponding hash value. 
The hash value of the certificate which is generated is stored on the blockchain which ensures that the cerficate is not tampered with or modified and anyone such as the institute, verifiers and students alike can view and verify the certificate by searching.
